**Work in Progress** - Building an ecommerce bookstore platform.

## About

This project is currently under active development. I am working on transforming this codebase into a full-featured ecommerce platform for a bookstore.

## Foundation

This project is built upon the excellent SaaS starter kit template from **[Makerkit](https://github.com/makerkit)**.

I want to express my sincere gratitude to the Makerkit team for creating and maintaining such a high-quality, production-ready template and making it available to the community. Their work has provided an incredible foundation to build upon.

**Please show your support by:**
- Starring their repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/makerkit)
- Checking out their work at [https://makerkit.dev](https://makerkit.dev)
- Following them for updates and improvements

## Tech Stack

This project uses modern technologies provided by the Makerkit template:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **Supabase** for authentication and database
- **Turborepo** for monorepo management
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **TailwindCSS v4** for styling
- **Shadcn UI** for beautiful components

## Getting Started

This project follows the same setup as the Makerkit template. Please refer to the [Makerkit documentation](https://makerkit.dev) for detailed setup instructions.

## Status

🚧 **Under Development**

This is a personal project in early development stages. Features and functionality are being actively built and modified.
